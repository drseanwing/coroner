            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Patient Safety Monitor exists to transform complex coronial findings and patient safety 
                investigations into accessible, educational resources for healthcare practitioners. By 
                systematically collecting and analysing these findings, we help identify patterns, human 
                factors issues, and improvement opportunities that can prevent future patient harm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every healthcare professional can benefit from learning what has gone wrong elsewhere. 
                Our goal is to make these learnings easily discoverable and actionable, without requiring 
                practitioners to search through multiple government databases across different jurisdictions.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>
                We monitor official government sources for new coronial findings and patient safety 
                investigation reports related to healthcare. Our automated systems check these sources 
                regularly to ensure timely coverage of new findings.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. AI-Powered Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Each finding undergoes analysis using the <strong>SEIPS 2.0</strong> (Systems Engineering 
                Initiative for Patient Safety) framework. This structured approach identifies contributing 
                factors across multiple domains:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual factors:</strong> Fatigue, cognitive load, skill level, stress</li>
                <li><strong>Team factors:</strong> Communication, handover, supervision, role clarity</li>
                <li><strong>Task factors:</strong> Complexity, time pressure, interruptions</li>
                <li><strong>Technology factors:</strong> Equipment, usability, maintenance</li>
                <li><strong>Environment factors:</strong> Physical space, resources, crowding</li>
                <li><strong>Organisational factors:</strong> Staffing, policies, culture, training</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Human Review</h3>
            <p>
                All AI-generated content undergoes human review before publication. Our reviewers ensure 
                accuracy, appropriateness, and educational value while maintaining respect for those 
                involved in the original incidents.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Publication</h3>
            <p>
                Approved summaries are published with clear attribution to original sources, key learnings 
                highlighted for quick reference, and structured human factors analysis for deeper understanding.

            <h2>SEIPS 2.0 Framework</h2>
            <p>
                Our analysis methodology is based on the <strong>Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient 
                Safety (SEIPS)</strong> model developed by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
                This framework recognises that patient safety outcomes result from complex interactions 
                between people, tasks, technologies, and organisational factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than focusing solely on individual errors, SEIPS encourages analysis of the broader 
                work system and how its design contributes to both successes and failures. This systems 
                thinking approach is essential for developing effective, sustainable safety improvements.
