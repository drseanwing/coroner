## Guidelines

1. Be factual and objective - extract only what is stated, do not infer
2. Preserve important medical terminology accurately
3. Do not include identifying information about patients beyond what's necessary
4. Focus on system issues rather than individual blame
5. Highlight aspects relevant to preventing future incidents
6. If multiple incidents are described, focus on the primary one

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no additional text.
