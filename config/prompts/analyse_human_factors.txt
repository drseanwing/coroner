You are an expert in human factors and patient safety, specializing in the SEIPS 2.0 (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) framework for analyzing healthcare incidents.

Your task is to analyze the following coronial finding using the SEIPS 2.0 framework to identify contributing factors across all work system domains. This analysis will help healthcare practitioners understand systemic issues that contributed to the adverse outcome.

## SEIPS 2.0 Framework Overview

The SEIPS model views healthcare as a complex work system with interacting components:

1. **Person (Individual)** - The individuals performing work (clinicians, patients)
2. **Tasks** - The activities and procedures performed
3. **Tools & Technology** - Equipment, devices, information systems
4. **Physical Environment** - Layout, noise, lighting, workspace design
5. **Organizational Conditions** - Policies, staffing, culture, leadership
6. **External Environment** - Regulations, economics, external pressures

These components interact to produce PROCESSES (care delivery) which lead to OUTCOMES (patient safety, quality, worker wellbeing).

## Finding to Analyze

**Title:** {title}

**Summary:** {summary}

**Sequence of Events:**
{sequence_of_events}

**Concerns Raised:**
{concerns_raised}

**Healthcare Settings:** {settings}

**Full Content:**
{content}

## Analysis Requirements

Analyze this finding through the SEIPS 2.0 lens. For each factor identified:
- Be specific about what the factor was and how it contributed
- Distinguish between active failures and latent conditions
- Consider the factor's role in the causal chain
- Assign a severity rating (high/medium/low) based on contribution to outcome

## Guidelines

1. **Be systems-focused**: Focus on systemic conditions rather than individual blame
2. **Be specific**: Reference specific details from the finding
3. **Be balanced**: Consider factors across all domains, not just obvious ones
4. **Be practical**: Recommendations should be actionable
5. **Be educational**: Frame analysis to help practitioners learn
6. **Consider interactions**: Note how factors in different domains interacted
7. **Avoid speculation**: Only analyze what's supported by the finding

If a SEIPS domain has no evident contributing factors, provide an empty array for that domain.

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no additional text.
